# I535---Data-Pipeline
5500 datasets store structured data from Form 5500, 5500-SF, and schedules of 800,000+ retirement and welfare benefit plans filed annually in the U.S. The datasets are provided by the U.S. Department of Labor (USDL) at [this link](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ebsa/about-ebsa/our-activities/public-disclosure/foia/form-5500-datasets). 
The goal of this project is to implement a pipeline to download, clean, integrate, transform, store, and visualize data. The metrics used for visualizations are total plan assets, total active participants, and average participant contribution of retirement plans in the 5500 datasets from Form 5500. Specific columns are extracted from the original data sources, then they are cleaned, integrated/transformed, summarized, and stored in BigQuery historically before creating visualizations.
I worked with other metrics that are extracted from 5500 datasets in a specific year. However, creating trends of metrics year over year from the 5500 datasets manually is very complicated. This project creates a pipeline to simplify the work related to these datasets and provide solutions for storing historical data from snapshot databases.
